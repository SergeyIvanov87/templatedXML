# templatedXML
Simple XML parser which uses compile-time customizable model-based approach to parse XML documents due to predefiend schema:
If you want to parse XML document just...
If you want to do not learn about XML very much...
If you like C++ very much....
If you like simple code...
You are welcome!


1) you determine what kind of elements in XML schema are necessary for your application
2) you make classes which inherit templatedXML mix-in classes
3) remember some classes are containers for other classes in scheme
4) just launch parsing from root node
5) just get result


<Example would be here soon>
